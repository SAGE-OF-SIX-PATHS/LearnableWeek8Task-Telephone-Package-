<h1 align="center">A TELEPHONE PACKAGE</h1>

###   This project is a telephone package built on JavaScript Programming using the Observer design pattern

####  The observer pattern is used for this project because of the following reasons:
<ol>
  <li><strong>The design pattern encapsulates a Subject-Observer Relationship</strong> &rarr; The telephone class (subject) maintains a list of observers and notifies them when a phone number is dialed.</li>
  <li><strong>It ensures Loose Coupling</strong> &rarr; The observers receive updates without tightly coupling them to the telephone class.</li>
  <li><strong>It facilitates Extensibility</strong> &rarr; New observers can be added dynamically without modifying the telephone class.</li>
</ol>
